# Introduction-To-Web-Scraping
Welcome to this repository made for a 2 hour lecture on web scraping, held at the University of Bonn.

Content: 
   - A short presentation. (pdf)
   - A Jupyter Notebook, which can be used to learn how to web scrape with selenium. It also contains a web scraper which should work for Twitter.

Feel free to resuse the code. If you do so, please leave a star.
